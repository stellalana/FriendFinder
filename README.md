## Purpose
I built this app as part of my coursework at the UNC Full-Stack program. This activity shows the ability to use Express and Path packages for routing and directory purposes. The app itself is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- similar to a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Additionally used Bootstrap's "Carousel" functionality as a clean and engaging landing page.
